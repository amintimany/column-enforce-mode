* column-enforce-mode
  Highlight text that extends beyond a certain column.

  This mode is meant to be a very lightweight, zero configuration, way to help enforce the 80 column rule. It can be configured for any N-column rule however.

What it looks like enforcing the 80 column rule:

** Usage
   Start it up interactively on the current buffer,
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   default startup:
   M-x: column-enforce-mode 

   or by specific rule function
   M-x: 80-column-rule
   #+END_SRC
   or tie it to a major mode:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'column-enforce-mode)
   #+END_SRC

** Create preconfigured N-column-rules
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (make-column-rule 110) ;; creates function `110-column-rule' for use interactively
   #+END_SRC
** Customizing the look
Customize `column-enforce-face' to change the look of the mode
