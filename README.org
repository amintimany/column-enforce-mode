* column-enforce-mode
  - Highlight text that extends beyond a certain column.
  - By default, it tries to enforce the 80 column rule
  - For more complex usage, use Emacs built-in whitespace-mode, this is meant to be very light

** Usage
   Start it up interactively on the current buffer,
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   M-x: column-enforce-mode
   #+END_SRC
   or tie it to a major mode:
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
   (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'column-enforce-mode)
   #+END_SRC
